# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to how null and undefined values are handled.  The bug arises from the potential for unexpected behavior when using loose equality (==) with null and undefined. The solution focuses on explicitly handling these values for better predictability and error prevention.
